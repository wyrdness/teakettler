      "full": "The Teakettler is a fearsome critter from American lumberjack folklore, described as a small cat-sized creature covered in armored scales. Its defining characteristics are running backwards at high speed while emitting steam and a whistling sound identical to a boiling teakettle. The creature was used to explain mysterious whistling sounds heard in forests, providing a humorous supernatural explanation for natural phenomena (wind, bird calls, or actual steam vents in some regions)."
